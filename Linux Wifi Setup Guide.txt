Linux Wifi Setup Guide

according to online guides it should be as such, did not work for me sadly

#wifi

ip link
wlo1 or such

#optionally run
lspci
#to see if you have a wifi adapter
replace wlo1 with your wifi adapter name

do su and login as root
touch /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlo1.conf

vi file 
add two new lines;
ctrl_interface=run/wpa_supplicant
update_config=1
:wq

wpa_passphrase WIFI_NAME PASSWORD(for wifi ofc) >> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlo1.conf
#optionally remove psk from the output
vi /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlo1.conf
it will add 
network={
    ssid="SSID"
    psk="PASSWORD"
}
or something similar
:wq

# Ensure the wireless interface is up
ip link set wlo1 up

wpa_supplicant -B -i wlo1 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlo1.conf
# Obtain an IP address using DHCP
dhclient wlo1

# Check if you are connected to the internet
ping goo.org or some site to check if you are connected to the internet
